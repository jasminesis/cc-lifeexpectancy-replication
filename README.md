# Climate change projected to reduce European life expectancy

This project converts published estimates of excess mortality for 28 European countries in life expectancy at birth differentials.

# Abstract
> Climate change related estimates of excess mortality clearly demonstrate the dramatic impact
on public health and human mortality from climate change. However, life expectancy at
birth is more easily communicated to the public, understood by the public, and controls for
different geographic, economic, and demographic groups. No studies have comprehensively
connected excess mortality due to climate change to anticipated reductions in life expectancy.
Without properly situating the potential loss of life within the contexts of life expectancy,
we risk misrepresenting cost of climate change on mortality. In this paper, we convert excess
mortality estimates into potential reductions of life expectancy at birth and report the cost of
climate change on human longevity. We find climate change could become the third largest
life expectancy reducer behind heart disease and cancer in some European countries. Thus,
the cost of inaction on climate change could approach one year of life in some countries.
